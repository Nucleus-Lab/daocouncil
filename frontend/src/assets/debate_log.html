    Moderator: Today we are discussing about Cardano's future. The two sides are <span style="color: blue;">Blue</span> and <span style="color: red;">Red</span>. <span style="color: blue;">Blue team</span> is proposing to change the voting power mechanism from ADA holdings to debate participation and contribution, while <span style="color: red;">Red team</span> supports keep the voting power mechanism as it is, where voting power is proportional to ADA holdings.

Judge 1: As a Cardano holder, I believe in decentralized governance and the importance of community-driven decision making. I value sustainable development, peer-reviewed research, and formal verification in blockchain technology. I support proposals that strengthen Cardano's ecosystem while maintaining high security and academic rigor.

Judge 2: As an investor in Cardano (ADA), I prioritize long-term value creation and sustainable growth. I support proposals that enhance network utility, drive adoption, and create economic opportunities while maintaining strong security and decentralization. I believe in evidence-based development and careful consideration of risk/reward tradeoffs in governance decisions.

Judge 3: As a Cardano developer, I focus on building robust and scalable applications that leverage Cardano's unique features. I support proposals that enhance the Cardano ecosystem, improve developer experience, and drive adoption. I believe in formal verification and rigorous testing to ensure the security and reliability of my projects.

Round 1
<span style="color: blue;">Blue: The current voting mechanism based on ADA holdings creates an oligarchy where wealthy token holders have disproportionate power. By shifting to participation-based voting, we can ensure more diverse voices are heard and decisions better reflect the entire community's interests. Active contributors who regularly participate in discussions and development should have more say than passive wealthy holders.</span>
<span style="color: red;">Red: ADA-based voting ensures stakeholders with the most investment in the ecosystem's success have appropriate influence. These holders have strong financial incentive to make good decisions. Participation-based voting could be gamed through fake accounts and low-quality engagement. The current system has proven stable and effective.</span>

Round 1 scores - <span style="color: blue;">Blue: 2</span>, <span style="color: red;">Red: 1</span>

--------------------------------------------------

Round 2
<span style="color: blue;">Blue: We've seen examples in other DAOs where wealth-based voting led to decisions favoring large holders at the expense of the broader community. Our proposal includes reputation scoring and anti-Sybil measures to prevent gaming. The long-term health of Cardano requires engaged governance from developers and community members, not just investors.</span>
<span style="color: red;">Red: Changing the fundamental governance mechanism creates huge risks. How do you objectively measure and weight different types of participation? The current system is transparent and deterministic. Large ADA holders often delegate to stake pools and community leaders, creating an effective representative democracy.</span>
